    "This notebook documents my attempt to ressurect an old, but very interesting paper that was begun by my Master's Thesis advisor and others but came to languish unpublished due to lack of time. My intent going into the project was to take the lead on running a replication of the original analysis that would reflect improvements on several fronts in the years since the original data analysis and tentative finding were produced. If the replication ran as planned, we would have a superior set of models based on better measures that would more clearly demonstrate the basic finding. \n",

    "This document focuses specifically on some of the more interesting challenges I dealt with in the beginning, middle, and end of the project, and discusses some of the data analysis \"life lessons\" I gleaned along the way. Should you develop headache, confusion, deja vu, or rage, please discontinue reading.\n",

    "A too-short summary is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ \"__Methods reproducibility__: provide sufficient detail about procedures and data so that the same procedures could be exactly repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ __Results reproducibility__: obtain the same results from an independent study with procedures as closely matched to the original study as possible.\n",

    "I present the code generally untouched but with simple markup and some samples of back-and-forth discussions (anonymized) for archival purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tl:dr for this entire analysis is: replication and inferential reproducibility are hard to achieve, documentation is almost never sufficient to support methods reproducibility, and results that are exciting but not robust can vanish in the wind. \n",

    "Things checked out. I next set about fine-tuning the new dataset to resemble the old as closely as possible. At this point, I found myself emailing older graduate students, post-docs, and even graduates or former employees to track down certain vital details about variable operationalization. While it might appear that the variable was adequately described in the tables, there were a number of what Andrew Gelman and others refer to as forks in the \"Garden of Forking Paths\" that were never documented and (8-10 years on) were completely lost to the memories of the PI and co-authors. But, in nearly every case, a snippet of old code, a footnote, or a recollection of a former analyst began to fill in the blanks. If I recall, we had only 1-2 variables where I truly had to guess at how the originals were transformed from the raw survey responses into the final form for analysis. In those cases, I started with a lengthy conversation with one or more of the lead authors."

Or, flipped around, young adults might be more inclined to stay put if there was still plently of unused forest land in the vicinity that could be converted to pasture or cropland. \n",

I took the lead and began \"stepping\" one change at a time from the original model to our latest attempt. In doing so, I began to ammass an incredibly long list of differences, any one of which could be responsible for the ultimate difference in outcomes. \n",

At each step, before and after the change, a metric had to be produced and compared. In some cases, it might be simple descriptives. In others, I would re-run the model itself. The latter was to help suss out potential interactions between more than one factor that might not be immediately apparent from a simple side-by-side comparison of aggregate statistics. Had I been a better programmer in those days, or more knowledgable about any of this, I might have developed much better, and faster, means of completing this task. \n",

    "One reason this stage took a long time was that we lacked one critical thing from those earlier attempts: the *code* itself.

    "+ legitimate fixes to the data that had occurred between rounds (meaning the old analyses may have been based in part n data that was flawed)\n",

    "Some of these may seem customary, while others might be a bit surprising. But, with a large, complex and ongoing (longitudinal) data collection effort, the assumption that the data are a static entity, carefully encased in cellophane wrapping, is not supportable. \n",

    "\n",
    "What does it mean? In short, our understanding of the social and geographic history of the villages in our dataset was an evolving product. With each wave of data collection, as well as with regular return visits, conversations with colleagues on the ground there, and independent research projects like the Field work of a graduate student, our understanding changed, mostly for the better. Collectively, the base of knowledge about the underlying subject matter was being broadened and deepened, but as a consequence, some of the things that were done in earlier times seemed quaint or downright wrong in hindsight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things like hindsight as sources of variation in results are tricky to diagnose because of the hard work that is done instilling in graduate students the need to revise, update, and challenge assumptions. The current paradigm is just part of the water we swim in, so it is extremely useful when faced with this sort of situation to arrange for \"inter-generational\" conversations between folks who were present at different stages or between senior and junior researchers. It was only through these imperfect but invaluable face-to-face conversations that some of these changes were surfaced. Had we not convened everyone together from the early and the later days, these changes would likely have remained buried as notes in long-dead email threads.\n",

    "OK, I could keep on with those (there were many iterations), but clearly you have the gist. I ran and re-ran a lot of models, descriptives, and other metrics for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "While I was busy with this over several months, the geographers on our team were hard at work on a similar process of comparison and differencing across the many iterations of their spatial classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an interesting, if infuriating, note. At the time, the social scientists on the team were somewhat aghast to learn that, owing to certain stochastic features of some of the classification algorithms, it was not possible in practice to repeat or re-create the exact results that would have been used in the original version of the paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "That these intermediate steps were lost to history was not inevitable, but all-too-common. This was more than just a matter of setting a random seed, though the specifics of the process were a bit outside my ouvre then (and certainly remain so today). But as a result, the hope that we could fully repeat that aspect of the analysis was dashed. Even the software worked against it with improvements and changes to code and to algorithms. To carry it out (in principle) would have required that we build authentic hardware and software replicas from 10 years prior (or really good emulators) and re-run the pertinent portions of the analysis along with parameters that were never recorded or preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was all quite maddening, but in the most interesting ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the by, we narrowed down our long list of possible candidates for the \"big factor\" that was responsible for our disappearing finding to the spatial data. While there were initially many small discrepancies between the original and the new versions of the survey-based social data (on individuals, households, and communities), these were systematically removed and then re-added one-by-one with little impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a few final versions of the model, I was able to bring to the team a fairly strong set of \"results about the results\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A snippet from a contemporaneous memo I drafted describes my hunch:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The village competition variables show little change.  It is the pattern metric and composition variables that have changed dramatically.  Following the means and other descriptives are simple correlation tables for the same groups of variables.  There is actually a negative correlation between the old and new values for number of forest patches for both years.  Lastly, I include a set of scatterplots that contrast the 2005 variables with the more recent 1998 variables.  From these, the lack of correspondence between the patch count variables is visually apparent.  The composition variables (% forest) show a pattern that one would anticipate, with the exception that nearly all villages show an increase or no change in % forest cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differences in these variables are substantial enough that they change the magnitude, significance, and in some cases, direction of the coefficients in the models.  My best hypothesis is that these differences are the result of the re-classification of the images that took place between 1998 and 2005.  My principal question is should I invest my time in attempting to reconcile these differences, or would we as a group prefer to use the earlier variable versions, based on older classification schemes?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The question at the end was especially fraught for a graduate student. In effect: how much more time would you have me pour into this black hole? On the other hand, would it even be defensible or right to walk all the back to the decades-old analysis and attempt to move ahead with those data and analysis (effectively dumping the past year's work into the wastebasket)? The obvious answer, given the few glaring mistakes and other concerns I had already uncovered with the original analysis was that it would be a difficult case to argue that it was the superious model (especially with the new analysis staring us in the face). I knew that my vote, at least, was to never put my name on that sort of thing. I also knew that, in all likelihood, if we did try to revert back to the older analysis, my contribution to the whole effort might be so diminished as to bump me to the last author, or right off the masthead altogether and into a footnote.

    "A big coming-together was scheduled. In preparation, I was able to successfully summarize all the things we had learned in the course of what amounted to a large-scale sensitivity analysis in a series of tables and visuals. These contained:\n",
    "+ 5 different sets of independent variables and controls (changes to the model)\n",
    "+ 2 approaches to measuring village competition (point-in-polygon vs. overlapping buffers)\n",
    "+ 5 different sets of underyling data (each containing every specification of every variable)\n",
    "+ 2 different classification years\n",
    "+ 2 different age groups\n",
    "\n",
    "In total this was 200 specifically-chosen models (out of hundreds of thousands).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving to the final part of the project, it's worth reflecting on whether this whole exercise transformed into a data-dredging exercise at some point. To be honest, it was something I began to worry about early in the process. Perhaps that's one reason why, as a group, we resisted the principle temptation in this whole affair, which would have been to simply select whichever of the 200+ models had the best appearance and characteristics (pick you metrics) and hasten that one to the publishers with a suitable set of post-hoc explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, to be clear, was never our modus operandi. Instead, and thankfully, everyone on board was invested in trying to understand *what* had happened, and if possibly *why* or *how* it had happened. Most of all, we wanted to understand what its implications were, in the immediate term for the survivability of the original paper, but in the longer term for our understanding of the complex and coupled human-environmental system that we were studying. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, we were engaged in asking a long series of \"what if\" questions with the goal not of improving model fit or some such thing, but with the tandem goals of a.) mapping all possible differences between the original highly complex analysis and the contemporary highly complex analysis. While I didn't get into it except to point out the possibility earlier, there were also strong indications that some of the most important \"effects\" observed in the original paper were likely to have been reproducible only through the interaction of more than one factor, at least one of which was, technically speaking, impossible to reproduce 10 years later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever else had happened during the original analysis (done in far less time as a rough pass in support of a conference presentation), one could reasonably infer that the team just got luckly. A cynic might go on to infer that something sinister occurred when the first analysis was conducted, amounting to the kind of specification search alluded to above. But, having sifted through veritable file drawers of alternative results and experienced firsthand the dizzying complexity of the problem, I am left to infer only this: good instincts and bad luck are the most likely culprits. The team, free to exercise some judgment in moving from theory to measurement and modeling, made some excellent choices (not realizing what might have obtained in all the other scenarios). This is not uncommon in the traditional confirmatory research tradition, where we put together what seems like a reasonable model and then roll the dice. The danger lies, of course, in what happens after a researcher \"rolls the dice\" - do they present the results more-or-less as found, or do they pick them up and roll again? The latter, as has been shown repeatedly to the point that an entirely new vocabularly had to be propounded (the \"False Positive\" crisis, Non-replication crisis, etc.) to be more common in practice than any of us should find acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the group was quite *unlucky* as well. Working with the best technology and methods available at the time, informed by current best practices, and working under any number of early misconceptions at the level of theory and knowledge, they made judgment call after judgment call, as all researchers do. A reasonably strong effort was made to document these calls, though, in keeping with how things were done more than a decade ago, no serious effort was ever put forth to *systematically* document those seemingly trivial decisions, not to subject the analysis to the kind of rigorous documentation that is increasingly becoming the norm for some disciplines, journals, and research communities. So, through what truly seems like good fortune, there was an interesting artifact found. It was picked up, turned around a few times, and shared with a small group of others via a conference session. \n",
    "\n",
    "What may be the most remarkable part of this story is that it was nearly 10 years later, and another 2 of difficult analysis, before the original finding was laid to rest. But it __was laid to rest__. No retraction was necessary, but the final impact was the same. Through this careful re-analysis, we at least ensured that the original paper was never dusted off and submitted for publication in something approaching its original form.\n",
    "\n",
    "I, for one, learned more than a dozen life-long lessons about statistical and analytical best practices - technical, procedural, philosophical, and even pedagogical - in a way that hammered these lessons deeply into my consciousness, not soon to be forgotten. While it did not restore to me my lost two years, I was able to use those same lessons to avoid costly mistakes in my other lines of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, I'm not afraid to say that the whole affair left me rather unfit for the conventional research track, simply because I was now primed to see flimsy research results for exactly what they were, and to take proactive steps to suss out whether my other results would withstand the same sort of analysis. Spoiler: they often did not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effects that are substantial, robust, and relevant are hard to find. Artifacts and chimeras resulting from tortuous overfitting and other dubious practices are, unfortunately about as common as Iron Pyrite. \n",

    "Through such techniques as pixel-by-pixel differencing and matching different land use and/or land cover class systems, they were able to produce a set of visuals that were both illuminating and frustrating. They essentially showed that in nearly every way that mattered, the underyling classifications and the summary measures that were built from those could vary wildly based upon how they were performed. Given the nature of the end to which we were trying to put those summary measures (a multi-level, multi-method, multi-disciplinary collaboration), it was unrealistic to expect any strong case to be made from the existing literature about which flavor among hundreds was the \"right\" approach. And, it was unfair of us to expect of our geographer colleagues that they somehow resolve this dilemma when we were all equally out of our element to the same extent when considering that the model and theory belonged to no one discipline. \n",
